# LogDx-CI Leaderboard

[← Home](index.html) · [Citation](cite.html) ·
[Technical report](https://github.com/eyuansu62/LogDx/blob/main/reports/e10_v2_generalization_partial.md)

All scores are case-count-weighted macro `diagnosis_score_v1_1`
aggregated across the **35-case v1.0 corpus** (3 splits: `dev`,
`holdout`, `stress`). The score formula (a calibrated linear
combination of category accuracy, signal-mention recall, file/test
recall, must-mention coverage, valid-evidence-quote rate, with
forbidden-claim and confident-error penalties) is documented in
[`docs/evaluation/diagnosis_eval_v1.md`](https://github.com/eyuansu62/LogDx/blob/main/docs/evaluation/diagnosis_eval_v1.md).

## Overall (35-case corpus, 3 debugger families)

Sorted by overall mean across the three debugger families.
**`confident_error` is the v1.1-calibrated rate** of confidently-wrong
diagnoses (`confidence ≥ 0.70` AND the diagnosis is demonstrably wrong
on multiple fronts) — lower is better. It is the metric closest to
"how often does this method lead an LLM to confidently misdiagnose a
CI failure," which is the failure mode raised in
[rtk-ai/rtk#1599](https://github.com/rtk-ai/rtk/issues/1599).

| Rank | Method | Haiku 4.5 | Sonnet 4.6 | gpt-5-mini | Overall | confident_error<br/><sub>(↓ better)</sub> | total_tokens<br/><sub>per case (↓ better)</sub> |
|----:|--------|----------:|----------:|----------:|--------:|--------:|--------:|
| 1 | `hybrid-grep-120k-rtk-tail` | 0.624 | 0.679 | 0.706 | **0.670** | **0.000** | 19,844 |
| 2 | `hybrid-grep-120k-tail`     | 0.610 | 0.730 | 0.658 | **0.666** | 0.010 | 19,753 |
| 3 | `grep`                      | 0.578 | 0.684 | 0.655 | **0.639** | **0.000** | 88,355 |
| 4 | `tail-200`                  | 0.595 | 0.624 | 0.623 | **0.614** | 0.019 | **6,108** |
| 5 | `hybrid-grep-4k-rtk-err-cat`<br/><sub>*(earlier 4k-threshold hybrid; replaced — see report)*</sub> | 0.552 | 0.597 | 0.571 | **0.573** | 0.029 | 19,892 |
| 6 | `rtk-err-cat`               | 0.455 | 0.488 | 0.467 | **0.470** | 0.029 | 19,850 |
| 7 | `raw`                       | 0.324 | 0.368 | 0.367 | **0.353** | **0.000** | 275,248 |
| 8 | `rtk-read`                  | 0.329 | 0.369 | 0.349 | **0.349** | 0.010 | 274,289 |
| 9 | `llm-summary-v1-mock`       | 0.343 | 0.348 | 0.294 | **0.328** | **0.133** | 432,076 |
| 10 | `rtk-log`                  | 0.238 | 0.262 | 0.249 | **0.249** | **0.133** | **810** |

Two layers of finding:

1. **Safety (confident_error)** — the top-3 methods produce zero or
   near-zero confidently-wrong diagnoses. `rtk-log` and
   `llm-summary-v1-mock` mislead a confident LLM on ~13% of cases
   ([rtk-ai/rtk#1599](https://github.com/rtk-ai/rtk/issues/1599)).

2. **Cost (total_tokens)** — `grep` (rank 3) uses **4.5× more tokens
   per case than the top-2 hybrids** while scoring lower. The hybrids
   dominate grep on both axes. `llm-summary-v1-mock` is the **most
   expensive method on the leaderboard at 432k tokens/case** (because
   the summarizer itself burns 430k tokens generating a 1.3k summary,
   pricing it out of any cost-quality consideration).
   See the [cost-quality Pareto plot](#cost-quality-pareto-frontier)
   below for the full picture.

## Cost-quality Pareto frontier

![Cost-quality Pareto frontier for LogDx-CI v1.0](figures/cost_quality_pareto.png)

x-axis is total LLM tokens consumed per case on a log scale
(reducer-internal LLM calls + context delivered to the diagnoser +
diagnoser output). y-axis is the published `diagnosis_score_v1_1`.

The frontier (4 methods, dashed line) is:

| Pareto-optimal method | total_tokens / case | diagnosis_score_v1_1 |
|---|---:|---:|
| `rtk-log`                   |     810 | 0.249 |
| `tail-200`                  |   6,108 | 0.614 |
| `hybrid-grep-120k-tail`     |  19,753 | 0.666 |
| `hybrid-grep-120k-rtk-tail` |  19,844 | 0.670 |

Every other method is **dominated** — some other method achieves at
least as good a score for fewer tokens, or strictly more score for
the same tokens. Most notable dominations:

- `grep` is **dominated by `hybrid-grep-120k-tail`** — same score
  ballpark (0.639 vs 0.666) at **4.5× fewer tokens** (88,355 vs
  19,753). If you're using `grep` today, the 120k-tail hybrid is a
  pure upgrade on both axes.
- `rtk-err-cat` is **dominated by `hybrid-grep-120k-tail`** —
  similar token cost, but the hybrid scores +0.20 higher.
- `llm-summary-v1-mock` is **dominated by every other method on
  the leaderboard**. At 432k tokens/case it's 22× more expensive
  than the hybrids while scoring rank-9. The hidden cost is the
  summarizer itself: 370k input + 60k output tokens to produce a
  1.3k-token summary fed to the diagnoser. Real LLM summarizers
  inherit this overhead; the v1.0 corpus does not have a real-Haiku
  summary run on the 35-case set (see "A note on llm-summary-v1-haiku"
  below).

### Cost breakdown (case-count-weighted macro)

| Method | reducer_in<br/>(LLM input) | reducer_out<br/>(LLM output) | context<br/>(→ diagnoser) | diag_out<br/>(diagnoser output) | **total** |
|---|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|
| `rtk-log`                   |       0 |      0 |     325 | 485 |     **810** |
| `tail-200`                  |       0 |      0 |   5,569 | 539 |   **6,108** |
| `hybrid-grep-120k-tail`     |       0 |      0 |  19,219 | 534 |  **19,753** |
| `hybrid-grep-120k-rtk-tail` |       0 |      0 |  19,311 | 533 |  **19,844** |
| `rtk-err-cat`               |       0 |      0 |  19,383 | 467 |  **19,850** |
| `hybrid-grep-4k-rtk-err-cat`|       0 |      0 |  19,388 | 504 |  **19,892** |
| `grep`                      |       0 |      0 |  87,862 | 494 |  **88,355** |
| `rtk-read`                  |       0 |      0 | 273,998 | 291 | **274,289** |
| `raw`                       |       0 |      0 | 274,944 | 304 | **275,248** |
| `llm-summary-v1-mock`       | 369,957 | 60,362 |   1,264 | 492 | **432,076** |

`reducer_in` and `reducer_out` are non-zero only for methods that
internally call an LLM (here, `llm-summary-*`). For `grep`/`tail`/
`rtk-*`/`raw` the reducer is a CPU-bound transform with no LLM cost.

Reducer runtime where measured (only available for RTK methods,
which write `external_tool.runtime_ms` into their manifests):

| Method | reducer_runtime |
|---|---:|
| `rtk-read`    |  9.9 ms |
| `rtk-log`     | 18.7 ms |
| `rtk-err-cat` | 35.4 ms |

`grep`/`tail` runtime is unmeasured in v1.0 but is empirically
sub-100ms for every case in the corpus (CPU-bound, single-pass).

### USD cost

USD cost per case is **not reported** in v1.0.1 because the
relevant provider list prices (Anthropic Haiku 4.5, Sonnet 4.6,
OpenAI gpt-5-mini) need to be pinned to a snapshot date and
versioned in the protocol lock for reproducibility. This will
land in v1.1 alongside the multi-turn / agent-loop benchmark
(see [`ROADMAP.md`](https://github.com/eyuansu62/LogDx/blob/main/ROADMAP.md#2--cost--latency-reporting--p0-for-v11)).

## Headline cross-family agreement

The **top-3** under each debugger family separately:

| Family | Top 3 |
|--------|-------|
| Claude Haiku 4.5 | `hybrid-grep-120k-rtk-tail`, `hybrid-grep-120k-tail`, `tail-200` |
| Claude Sonnet 4.6 | `hybrid-grep-120k-tail`, `grep`, `hybrid-grep-120k-rtk-tail` |
| OpenAI gpt-5-mini | `hybrid-grep-120k-rtk-tail`, `hybrid-grep-120k-tail`, `grep` |

**∩ across all 3 families:**
`{hybrid-grep-120k-rtk-tail, hybrid-grep-120k-tail}` —
**both 120k-threshold hybrid routers**, beating every non-hybrid
single-method baseline on at least one family and on the overall
mean.

The **bottom-4 set** also agrees across all three families:
`{raw, rtk-read, rtk-log, llm-summary-v1-mock}` — context that's
either too large (raw / rtk-read on big logs) or too lossy
(rtk-log / mock summary) for the LLM to identify root causes.

## Methodology evolution

`hybrid-grep-4k-rtk-err-cat` (rank 5 overall) was an earlier hybrid
designed in the prototype phase, tuned at a 4k-token primary
threshold. Its successors `hybrid-grep-120k-tail` and
`hybrid-grep-120k-rtk-tail` use a 120k-token threshold with
explicit `rtk_input_truncated` gating and clear the earlier hybrid
by **~10 percentage points** on the 35-case corpus.

See the [technical report §3](https://github.com/eyuansu62/LogDx/blob/main/reports/e10_v2_generalization_partial.md#3-headline-result--full-table)
for the prototype-vs-formal corpus analysis that motivated the
threshold change.

## A note on `llm-summary-v1-haiku`

A real Anthropic Haiku summarizer (`llm-summary-v1-haiku`) was run
during prototyping on a 16-case subset but **not** re-run on the
full 35-case corpus, so it's not on the headline leaderboard. Its
subset score is 0.490 on Haiku-as-debugger; Sonnet and gpt-5-mini
aren't scored against it (would have required a paid re-run). See
the report §3 for context.

## How to reproduce a number

```bash
git clone https://github.com/eyuansu62/LogDx.git
cd LogDx

# rebuild the .cache/diagnosis/ tree from canonical manifests (one-time)
python3 tools/migrate_cache_keys_codex_2026_06_08.py

# re-run an eval block (deterministic; uses cached diagnoses)
python3 tools/evaluate_diagnosis.py \
    --split v2/dev --diagnoser real-debugger-v3

# the file lands at results/v2/dev/eval_diagnosis_real-debugger-v3.json
# and the per-method macro scores match the breakdown in §3 of the
# technical report.
```

The on-disk split names (`dev`, `holdout`, `stress`,
`v2/dev`, `v2/holdout`, `v2/stress`) reflect two methodology-
development waves during prototyping; both are merged into the
v1.0 corpus. See [the release notes](https://github.com/eyuansu62/LogDx/blob/main/RELEASE_NOTES.md#a-note-on-internal-naming)
for the mapping.

For a **fresh** re-run that hits the OpenAI / Anthropic APIs (not
just cache replay), see the
[reproducibility section in RELEASE_NOTES.md](https://github.com/eyuansu62/LogDx/blob/main/RELEASE_NOTES.md#reproducibility).

## 20 historical exclusions

The eval injects zero-score abstention rows for 20 (split,
diagnoser, method, case) tuples documented in
[`configs/historical_provider_error_exclusions.json`](https://github.com/eyuansu62/LogDx/blob/main/configs/historical_provider_error_exclusions.json).
These correspond to transient model / CLI / API failures during the
2026-04..05 prototype sweeps that were removed by the 2026-06-09 /
2026-06-10 cleanups. Without injection the eval denominator would
artificially shrink, inflating the macro means. The
`validate_eval_manifest_consistency.py` release gate verifies that
every excluded eval row has `diagnosis_success=False` + zeroed
score fields.

## Method references

Methods in the leaderboard are implemented as follows. Methods with
external dependencies are linked to their upstream projects.

| Method | Implementation |
|--------|----------------|
| `raw` | full log handed to the model |
| `tail-200` | last 200 lines |
| `grep` | regex-filtered failure-pattern lines + 3/8 context, see [`docs/methods/diagnosis.md`](https://github.com/eyuansu62/LogDx/blob/main/docs/methods/diagnosis.md) |
| `rtk-read`, `rtk-log`, `rtk-err-cat` | three modes of **[RTK (Rust Token Killer)](https://github.com/rtk-ai/rtk)** by rtk-ai. See [`docs/methods/rtk.md`](https://github.com/eyuansu62/LogDx/blob/main/docs/methods/rtk.md) for setup. |
| `llm-summary-v1-mock` | mock summarizer (deterministic stub; the corresponding real-Haiku run is `llm-summary-v1-haiku`, prototype-only) |
| `hybrid-grep-4k-rtk-err-cat` | earlier 4k-threshold hybrid using grep primary + rtk-err-cat fallback (replaced by the 120k hybrids) |
| `hybrid-grep-120k-tail` | grep ≤ 120k tokens else tail-200 |
| `hybrid-grep-120k-rtk-tail` | grep ≤ 120k tokens else rtk-err-cat (if not truncated and ≤ 120k) else tail-200 |
